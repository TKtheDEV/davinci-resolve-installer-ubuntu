# Installer for Davinci Resolve on Ubuntu 24.10 and 25.04
### (probably works on older version too)
### This installs the missing libraries, runs the resolve installer and copies libraries into the Davinci DIR

## Prerequisites
The Davinci Linux Installer .zip in ~/Downloads

Root privileges (Sudo)

## Installer
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TKtheDEV/davinci-resolve-installer-ubuntu/refs/heads/main/TK_resolve_installer.sh && chmod +x TK_resolve_installer.sh && ./TK_resolve_installer.sh && rm ./TK_resolve_installer.sh
```
### If you run into any issues, feel free to open an issue and I'll have a look.
